Readme Xournal AppleScript wapper
by JÃ¸rgen Rieck

Introduction

Xournal is an application for notetaking, sketching, keeping a journal using a stylus. It is free software (GNU GPL) and runs on Linux (recent distributions) and other GTK+/Gnome platforms.
This is an AppleScript wrapped as an Application bundle (.app) for Mac OS X. It contains the resources an icons for OS X to recognize it as an ordinary application. It does not contain the actual application or any of the needed libraries, it only provides better usability and integration with Mac OS X, Finder and the Dock.


Installation

Download the .app bundle and place it in your Applications folder.
It assumes that xournal is installed with MacPorts and that the binary file is located in /opt/local/bin/xournal. If you have installed it in any other way, or the binary is in another location, you will have to change the symlink in Xournal.app/Contents/MacOS/xournal and make it point in the right direction.

For installing MacPorts, see:
www.macports.org/

You'll also need the developer tools from Apple to compile Xournal and the dependencies:

For information on how to symlink, please read the man pages:
